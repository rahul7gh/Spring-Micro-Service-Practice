Spring Cloud is collection of indivisual projects so they don't actual come under a single groupId. To keep all the projects dependecueies
and versions comptable the SPing team releases thema under what they call a "release Train".To refer to  apericular release train
version we have "<dependencyManagement>" tag which is used to specify BOM(Billl of Models) for release train.

Spring Cloud projects have one more config file boostrap.prperties or.yml which is loaded before the application.prop or yml file
it is used to store core config properties which are not specfic to this appliation but entire ecosystem as whole.
Specifically boostrap file is used by parent ApplicationContext.

 The serach-locations provided in bootstrap file will require files for each microservices with following
 naming conention:-  appname-envname.yml or .properties
 
 when there is no env specified spring boot will load the default application properties file.
 and when you have a spefi env specified it will load up that file. and return the properies in a json response.
 in case of env specifi request both default and env properties are returned. due to the way spring reslves these urls .
  
 
 http://localhost:8071/licensing-service/default
 http://localhost:8071/licensing-service/dev
 http://localhost:8071/licensing-service/prod
 
 Now you can featch config data suhc database urls,etc...reqired by your mircoservice to setup from this service.
 
 ***********************For some reason Spring config server is not reading data from the Bootstrap.yml
  so i have put it in applicatio.yml***************
