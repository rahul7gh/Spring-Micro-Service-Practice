What is SPring cloud:- Collection of different projects each of which provides a esy wy to
satisy the common patterns observed in any miroservice based application.
Many of these projects are based on projects created by different organization.

1. Spring Cloud Config :- All application config data such environment details is accssed
thoruh a cetralized service rather than hardcoding it somewhere within the applicatiion itself

This ensures that no matter how many instances of MicroService exist tey all will have same
configuration.
This proj has its own property manageent repo but can also integrate with OpenSource Project such as
Git,Consul,Eureka,etc.

2.Spring coud service discovery: Hardcoding the Microservice endpoints will reult
in very poor change management. Lso or clients to keep track of tese becomes a tedious task.
This proj allows to map a mircoservices to logical names,Through registraion and deregs. framework

Consul,ZooKeeper and Eureka are most widely used.

3.Spring Cloud Load Balamcer and Resillience4j:-
A Robust fraemwork to handle the failures as well as the effective usage of avilable 
microservice instances.

4.Spring cloud API Gateway:-
ENsure all calls are passed torugh a single front door. Soo all the actual working services
are behnid this project. ALlows us to configure authentication and authorizzation
in a cetralized manner.
Basically it routes requests to appropriate applicatins.

5.Spring Cloud Stream: easy integration of asynchrnous messaginginto you application.

6.SPring Cloud sleuth:- allows tarcking particular transaction in your ecosystem through
a framework of identifiers.Real power comes when this is integrated with logging aplications
such as ELK stak,Zipkin,etc.

7.Spring Cloud Security:
authentiation and authorizaton project. Great suppot to implement entire security 
using token based approach based on Oauth2 and JWTs. 
 
RestTemplate class is configured to work with Sevice discovry as well as 
load balancing. so all you need to do is configure your applicaton with a discovery 
microservice and you are good to go.

Such client side balancing has advangate over centrlized load balancer as if te cenralized one goes down 
entire ecosystem gets diturbed.
